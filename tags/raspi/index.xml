      <description>Recently, I found myself in need of SSL traffic analysis coming out of IoT and mobile devices. After some considerations about the setup of monitoring gear I ended up with using Raspberry Pi 3 as a platform for that because most of the devices were with wifi only and I needed something more mobile at hand. There are some guides to set such platform up but I found them lacking certain things that prevented the whole thing from working for me.</description>
